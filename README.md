# README #

**Spamalysis** is a school project that we developped for 5 months at Telecom SudParis.

It aims at analyzing spam emails received on a particular email server. It uses an Elasticsearch node and Kibana to index emails and create various charts. This repository only provides the Python source code we wrote to process emails and index them.

For futher information, please take a look at our final report : https://bitbucket.org/warsang/spamalysis/downloads/final-report.pdf

If you have any question, don't hesitate to send us an email.

### Documentation ###

We did not write any separate documentation, but the source code is documented and it is Python anyway.
